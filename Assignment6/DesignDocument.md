## 1 Design Considerations

### 1.1 Assumptions

*Describe any assumption, background, or dependencies of the software, its use, the operational environment, or significant project issues.*

* It will be assumed that all customer data including shopping cart lists of coupons and products can fit in one QR Code.
* The GUI operations will be handled within the Main() method and are not modeled.
* Coordination between GUI operations and operations within the classes are handled by the Main() method.
* The QRCode generated when the customer card is scanned is in the same format as the QRCode generated when the customer chooses to pay.
  * The only difference is that the QRCode generated by the pay() method has the bill's requirements (shopping cart contents and total value) appended to the customer information in the QR code. 
  * The QR code on the customer card has space holders for that information but there is no data withnin the holders. 
  * The CustomerQRCode decode() method recognizes the lack of shopping cart contents and total value in the card's QR Code and then initializes an empty ShoppingCart within the Customer class during the instantiation of that class.
* If a product QR Code has the AB prefix then the ProductQR code decode method sets the Product isAlcbev flag to true.
  * If the Product isAlcBev flag is set to true then the getTotalCost() method will automatically calculate the special tax for that item.
### 1.2 Constraints

*Describe any constraints on the system that have a significant impact on the design of the system.*

* The system is constrained by the amount of data that can fit into a QR Code.

### 1.3 System Environment

*Describe the hardware and software that the system must operate in and interact with.*

## 2 Architectural Design

### 2.1 Component Diagram

The two major components in this system are the EZ Shop App and the POS System. There are three provided components: the QR Code Scanner, Payment Processing, and E-mail Processing. The EZ Shop App provides the interface between itself and the POS System in the form of a QR Code rendered on its screen that can be scanned by the POS System. The POS System uses the EX Shop App to read and then decode a QR code that has all the information necessary to display a bill on the POS System screen. Both the EZ Shop App and the POS System use the QR Code Scanner component. The QR Code Scanner provides the interface with both by decoding the QR Codes it scans into text format that can be transmitted to those components.

### 2.2 Deployment Diagram

The two major devices in the system are the customer's Android phone and the cashier's cash register. The QR Code Scanner Component is present on both pieces of hardware.

### 3.2 Other Diagrams

*<u>Optionally</u>, you can decide to describe some dynamic aspects of your system using one or more behavioral diagrams, such as sequence and state diagrams.*

## 4 User Interface Design


###4.1 Shopping Mode Screen

* This is the primary screen for the EZShop App. It has the add coupon/product button, the subtract product button, and the pay button. In addition it has the small "X" that allows the customer to exit the app.

###4.2 QR Code Scanner Screen

* This is the QR Code Scanner screen that is used anytime a QR code is scanned. This is also launched during the app launch. The only differences are the confirmation or error messages that are produced based on the expected format of the incoming code as defined by the application prior to launching the scanner.
